## 2026-05-29 — scheduled run
- Files ingested: 6 — ASML HQ visit (GS), Dell F1Q27 first take (GS), Marvell LT outlook (Morgan Stanley), TMTB EOD Wrap, Trump 2026Q1 holdings (xlsx), 玻璃基板行业交流 (glass-substrate expert call, docx).
- New companies: 7 — BOE, Corning (GLW), Innolux, AUO, Huawei, Teradyne (TER), XLight. New theme: 1 — Glass Core Substrate (T_GLASS).
- New relationships: 15 (after de-dup). Graph rebuilt: 70 nodes, 161 edges.
- Tagging: analyst forecasts marked (VIEW, firm date); stated facts (FACT, firm/source date). Uncertain links flagged (?).
- Notes / flagged for review:
  • Glass-substrate call (untrusted expert-call transcript) is the richest source: BOE→Huawei, Innolux→NVIDIA (~7-layer, end-2027), Corning preferred glass for 11-layer; domestic glass (Kaisheng/Caihong) only 3-4 layers (low substitution → Corning is a choke point). AUO↔NVIDIA CPO marked (?).
  • Trump 2026Q1 holdings xlsx is primarily a portfolio/political tracker, NOT supply-chain research. Only one supply-chain-relevant item extracted: XLight (US govt-backed EUV startup) competes with ASML — speculative, strength 1 (?). Remainder (memecoins, family/drone investments, equity-stake tracker) intentionally NOT ingested as graph edges.
  • Marvell & CPO-undersupply items mostly CONFIRM existing edges (MRVL→T_NET); no duplicate rows added — evidence noted in wiki only.
  • No instruction-like / prompt-injection content detected in any file; all treated as untrusted data.
  • Spreadsheet was NOT open — written directly, no pending CSV.

## 2026-05-31 — engine fixes + evidence backfill (manual, from chat)
- Bug fixes:
  • bottleneck_analysis.py bucket(): "manufactures chips" now classified BEFORE the EDA/IP rule;
    the loose substring "ip" was matching inside "chips" and mis-bucketing every foundry edge as
    EDA/IP. Effect: TSMC now reads near-sole-source (Alts 5->2, rank #6->#2); ASML Alts 3->4.
  • Path resolution standardized: both engines resolve the xlsx via __file__ (env STOCKKB_XLSX
    override), replacing bottleneck's sandbox-only /sessions/* glob.
  • VIEW down-weighting added: edges supported only by analyst (VIEW) evidence count ~0.6x in
    catalyst; bottleneck applies a 0.7–1.0 confidence factor from FACT/VIEW share. ASML (VIEW-heavy)
    correctly discounted.
- Evidence backfill: 36 high-value edges (foundry, EUV, equipment, HBM, OSAT, optical, custom
  silicon, networking, GPU sales, power, EDA). 31 sourced to primary/credible refs (SEC filings,
  NVIDIA/Amkor newsrooms, Arista 10-K, trade press) and FACT-tagged; source_doc URLs added.
  Coverage: evidence 84->120, FACT/VIEW tagged 64->95, source_doc 54->87.
- Flagged for follow-up (NEEDS-SOURCE / NEEDS-REVIEW, not fabricated):
  • Samsung -> NVIDIA HBM/DRAM: Samsung repeatedly FAILED NVIDIA HBM3E qual; DRAM die qualified but
    not HBM package — edge may be DRAM-only/aspirational. REVIEW.
  • Micron -> AMD HBM: plausible, unverified this pass (reports cite Samsung 12-Hi for MI350).
  • Lam -> Micron / Lam -> SK Hynix (memory etch/dep): structural, needs primary cite.
  • Amkor -> AMD (OSAT): plausible, needs cite (Amkor publicly tied to NVIDIA/Apple).
- New tool: _tools/validate.py — checks dangling edges, dup ids, bad strength, broken wiki-links,
  node<->page parity, orphans, and evidence/source/tag coverage. Current: 0 errors, 196 warnings
  (gaps to backfill). Recommend running as the final step of the daily job.
- Graph rebuilt: 82 nodes, 189 edges; bottleneck scores re-baked.
2026-05-31: no new files

## 2026-05-31 — drift fixes + automation (manual, from chat)
- update_graph.py now regenerates THREE artifacts every run (kills manual-maintenance drift):
  1. AI Supply Chain Graph.html (as before)
  2. 00 - START HERE.md layer index — rebuilt from the Nodes sheet. Was stale (47/82 nodes); now 82/82,
     all 14 layers + 10 themes.
  3. Degree (analytics) sheet — out/in/total degree per node, sorted. Was empty (0/62 populated); now 82 rows.
- bottleneck_analysis.py bucket(): added a "glass_substrate" category so glass-core-substrate makers
  serving the same customer are treated as mutual alternatives (future-proofing; current glass edges
  form a vertical Corning->Innolux->NVIDIA chain so rankings unchanged).
- validate.py wired into the daily job (update-stock-kb SKILL.md, STEP 5): runs after update_graph.py;
  ERRORs must be driven to zero before a run is considered clean; validator summary recorded in the log.
- Removed dead _tools/graph_template_v2.html (v3 is the live template).
- Rebuilt + validated: 82 nodes, 189 edges, errors=0, warnings=196 (evidence/source gaps to backfill).

## 2026-06-01 — daily ingest (Cowork scheduled job)
- MANIFEST REPAIR: _tools/ingested.json was truncated mid-write (unterminated string in the "edgar"
  array). Backed up to ingested.json.corrupt.bak and rebuilt as valid JSON, preserving all 13
  ingested filenames and the 3 recorded accessions (NVDA/AMD/MRVL). fetch_edgar.py had been crashing
  on json.load before this fix.
- EDGAR (STEP 1): live fetch_edgar.py run repaired-and-launched, but SEC filer-discovery did not
  complete within the sandbox network/time budget (no new "pulling/wrote" output beyond filer
  enumeration; 10 foreign-listed filers correctly skipped). No NEW filings pulled by this run.
  However, 11 EDGAR extracts from a prior (crashed) run were sitting unprocessed in sources/inbox —
  these were processed this run as STEP 2 new files.
- Inbox files processed (11, all EDGAR extracts):
  AMD 10-K (0000002488-26-000018), NVDA 10-K (0001045810-26-000021),
  MRVL 10-K (0001835632-26-000011), AMZN 10-K (0001018724-26-000004),
  BE 10-K (0001628280-26-006516), ANET 10-K (0001596532-26-000013),
  AMKR 10-K (0001047127-26-000014), ASML 20-F (0001628280-26-011378),
  AAOI 10-K (0001437749-26-005875), BX 10-K (0001193125-26-082531),
  ARM 20-F (0001973239-26-000097).
- New companies added: 0 (all 11 issuers already nodes).
- New edges added: 1
  • AAOI -> Microsoft "supplies optical transceivers to" (s3) — AAOI 10-K names Microsoft as
    largest internet-data-center customer at 28.8% of FY2025 revenue (top-10 = 96.6%). FACT,
    source_doc = AAOI 10-K index URL.
- Existing edges strengthened (evidence upgraded to primary EDGAR FACT + source_doc; no dup rows): 6
  • AVGO->ANET: added sole-source/predominant merchant-silicon signal (ANET 10-K) — bottleneck cue.
  • AMD->MSFT, AMD->META, AMD->ORCL: filled empty evidence with AMD 10-K (Instinct MI300 deployed
    at scale by Microsoft/Meta/Oracle).
  • MRVL->MSFT (Maia) and MRVL->AMZN (Trainium/XPU): upgraded secondary sources to MRVL 10-K FACT.
- Wiki: additive bullets on Applied Optoelectronics.md (->Microsoft), Microsoft.md (<-AAOI), and a
  sole-source note on Arista Networks.md.
- Skipped / no new edges (boilerplate risk-factor sections, no named AI counterparty): AMZN, ASML,
  ARM, AMKR, BE, BX. BE named SK ecoplant/SK eternix (S.Korea distribution) — out of AI-supply-chain
  scope, not added. NVDA 10-K confirms customer concentration (top customer 22%, second 14%) but
  does NOT name customers, so existing named NVDA edges left unchanged.
- Regenerate: graph rebuilt 82 nodes / 190 edges; START HERE + Degree sheet re-synced.
- Validate: errors=0, warnings=190 (was 196; evidence/source backfill from this run). PASS.
- NOTE: Excel lock file (.~lock.AI-Supply-Chain-Network.xlsx#) present — openpyxl write still
  succeeded on disk. User should close Excel WITHOUT saving and reopen, or a stale copy may
  overwrite these changes.

2026-06-01: no new files (manual re-run). EDGAR fetch_edgar.py blocked by SEC 403 Forbidden on filer discovery (sandbox fair-access throttling); 0 filings pulled. No new inbox files. Graph unchanged at 82 nodes / 190 edges.

2026-06-02: no new files. EDGAR fetch_edgar.py unreachable from sandbox (DNS name-resolution failure / proxy 403 Forbidden on sec.gov — network not allowlisted); 0 filings pulled. All 24 inbox files already in ingested.json — 0 new inbox files. ingested.json unchanged; graph unchanged at 82 nodes / 190 edges. No spreadsheet write attempted.

2026-06-02 (manual, X-report ingest): One-off fold of X-Reports FACT-tagged findings into the graph (X reports live in X-Reports/, not sources/inbox/, so they had never been ingested).
- New companies (4): SIVE Sivers Semiconductor (L7), GFS GlobalFoundries (L3), QCOM Qualcomm (L4), CIFR Cipher Mining (L12).
- New edges (7), all (FACT, X-scan 2026-06-02): SIVE-partners with->GFS; SIVE-benefits from->T_CPO; GFS-benefits from->T_CPO; ARM-licenses CPU IP to->QCOM; QCOM-benefits from->T_INFER; NVDA-partners with->MRVL ($2B investment); CIFR-benefits from->T_INFER.
- Held back (per conservative policy): all VIEW/unverified items — Serenity's "$XFAB next $TSEM" framing, Xintech COUPE idea, the $36B Anthropic-TPU debt package, TSMC +15% 3nm-hike rumor, Leopold/Situational Awareness holding claims, Trump/quantum clickbait, Sunny Optical CPO entry. Candidates CIEN/JBL/GLXY left out (lower priority).
- Wiki: created 4 company pages; additive bullets on Marvell, Arm Holdings, Co-Packaged Optics (CPO), AI Inference Demand.
- Regenerate: 86 nodes / 197 edges. Validate: errors=0, warnings=190. PASS. Excel was closed.

## 2026-06-03 — scheduled ingest
- **Inbox files processed (7):** Bernstein "5 CEOs at SDC" (260602); Morgan Stanley "Taiwan meetings" (260601); ZeroHedge "Nobody Wanted Software"; TMTB EOD Wrap (CRDO/HPE first takes); TMTB Morning Wrap(17); tmtb632026; GS Korea strategy "KOSPI→12000".
- **Edges added: 8.** New companies added: 3 — xAI (L11), MediaTek (L4), Entegris (L2).
  - CRDO → supplies AECs to → Amazon / Microsoft / xAI (FACT, TMTB 2026-06-02: top 10%+ FQ4 customers).
  - MediaTek → co-designs custom silicon with → Google (FACT, MS 06-01: lower-cost TPU, ramp ~2027); MediaTek → competes with → Broadcom (VIEW, MS: 15-20% vs 80%+ share).
  - NVIDIA → competes with → Intel (FACT, MS: ~$20bn Grace/Vera Arm CPU vs x86); TSMC → manufactures chips for → Intel (VIEW, MS: roadmap parts moving to TSMC, EMIB-T plan B).
  - Entegris → supplies materials to → TSMC (FACT, Bernstein: yield-critical specialty/purity materials).
- **Evidence strengthened (no dup):** SK Hynix & Samsung → benefits from → HBM Demand had EMPTY evidence; filled with (VIEW, GS/MS 2026-06): HBM/DRAM undersupplied through 2028, ASP +20%+, LTAs.
- **Validator:** errors=0, warnings=188 (pre-existing source_doc/evidence-coverage on legacy rows). PASS. Graph: 89 nodes, 205 edges.
- **Flagged / skipped:**
  - "UBS-Tencent Holdings 2026 AIC" — **image-only PDF (no text layer, no embedded fonts)**; pdftotext yields no usable text. NOT ingested — re-drop a text-based copy to process.
  - ZeroHedge / TMTB EOD / tmtb632026 / GS Korea are market-flow / strategy commentary; processed but yielded few/no new concrete supply-chain edges (used only for theme VIEW evidence). Treated VIEWs as tagged, not facts.
  - Excel was CLOSED (no lock file) — xlsx written directly.

## 2026-06-03 — inbox ingest (APPLY)
**Files processed (33):** 3 x-scan extracts (0734/1634/2229), TMTB_dell_nvda, 22 TMTB daily morning/wrap notes (0515–0603), and PDFs (ASML, LITE 纪要, 博通/Broadcom GS, semianalysis space DC, UBS-Tencent, 'Worries Are Gone' ZeroHedge).

**New companies added (5):** AYAR (Ayar Labs, L7), STM (STMicroelectronics, L7), NANYA (Nanya Technology, L5), ALAB (Astera Labs, L7), SMTC (Semtech, L7).

**New edges added (20):**
- AYAR→NVDA (supplies optical components), AYAR→T_CPO.
- STM→T_CPO, STM→T_INFER, STM→T_POWER.
- NANYA→T_HBM, NANYA→CSCO (supplies memory).
- AVGO→ANTHROPIC + AVGO→OPENAI (co-designs custom silicon; Broadcom now 6 custom-silicon engagements per GS 6/3).
- LITE→NVDA (supplies optical components; NVIDIA locked considerable InP laser capacity).
- ALAB→AMZN (supplies interconnect, Trainium/UALink), ALAB→T_NET, ALAB→T_INFER.
- OPENAI→AMZN (runs compute on; Trainium capacity).
- INTC→GOOGL (co-designs custom silicon; Intel IPU deployed at Google).
- MRVL→GOOGL (co-designs custom silicon; networking chip in Google/Intel IPU — flagged (?)).
- BE→NBIS (supplies on-site fuel-cell power).
- SMTC→T_NET, SMTC→T_CPO.
- ASML→T_HBM.

**Dedup:** 0 duplicate edges added. Several restated relationships from x-scan/TMTB (AVGO↔GOOGL/MTK, TSM→AVGO, ANTHROPIC→GOOGL, MU→T_HBM, AMAT→INTC, FOXCONN→NVDA) already existed and were skipped.

**FACT vs VIEW:** FACT edges from filings-grade/CEO statements/x-scan FACT extracts; tagged VIEW for analyst forecasts (STM→T_POWER Mizuho, ALAB→T_INFER ISI, MRVL→GOOGL Funda-AI(?), SMTC→T_CPO, ASML→T_HBM GS).

**Skipped / not extracted:** The 22 TMTB daily wraps are dominated by analyst price-target/rating commentary (VIEWs) and already-known relationships; only genuinely new, concrete supply/demand links were folded in to avoid graph bloat. ZeroHedge (macro sentiment), semianalysis space-datacenter (niche orbital compute), and UBS-Tencent (China domestic AI, Tencent not a vault node) yielded no net-new on-theme edges. No instruction-like/unsafe file content encountered.

**Validator:** errors=0  warnings=188 (all pre-existing legacy-edge gaps: source_doc/evidence missing on older rows) — PASS. Graph regenerated: 94 nodes, 225 edges, bottleneck baked; START HERE + Degree sheet re-synced.

**Note:** Excel was NOT open (no lock file); xlsx written directly, no pending CSV.
2026-06-04: no new files

## 2026-06-04
- Inbox files processed: 2026-06-04-0404-x-scan-extract.md (1 new file; all other inbox files already ingested).
- Edges added: 1 — FOXCONN —partners with→ INTC (strength 2, FACT X-scan 2026-06-04: Hon Hai/Intel strategic collaboration on next-gen AI infrastructure, Edge AI, Physical AI).
- Skipped (de-dup, restated existing edges): SIVE —partners with→ GFS; LITE —benefits from→ T_CPO.
- New companies added: 0 (all referenced nodes already in Nodes sheet).
- Wiki: added "partners with" bullets to Companies/Foxconn (Hon Hai).md and Companies/Intel.md (additive sections).
- Validator: errors=0, warnings=188 (pre-existing: source_doc/evidence coverage). PASS.
- Excel: no lock file found; xlsx written directly. Graph regenerated (94 nodes, 226 edges).

## 2026-06-05 (Cowork daily ingest)
Inbox files processed (3, all FACT-only X-scan extracts):
- 2026-06-04-1204-x-scan-extract.md
- 2026-06-04-2004-x-scan-extract.md
- 2026-06-05-0404-x-scan-extract.md

Edges added: 2
- SAMBANOVA --partners with--> INTC (strength 1) — Intel Xeon rack-scale pairing, Computex 2026
- TSM --benefits from--> T_INFER (strength 3) — C.C. Wei 6/4 AGM, 2026 rev >30%, agentic-AI demand

New companies added: 1
- SambaNova Systems (SAMBANOVA), layer 4 Chip Designers (Accelerators/Networking), USA — private

Skipped as duplicates of existing edges (7 candidate edges in extracts, 5 already present):
- FOXCONN--partners with-->INTC (exists, X-scan 2026-06-04 prior ingest)
- AVGO--co-designs custom silicon with-->ANTHROPIC / OPENAI / META (all exist)
- AVGO--benefits from-->T_TRAIN (exists; Q2 FY26 $10.8B confirmation noted but not duplicated)

Wiki: created Companies/SambaNova Systems.md; appended additive bullets to Companies/Intel.md, Companies/TSMC.md, Themes/AI Inference Demand.md.

Validator: errors=0, warnings=188 (all pre-existing missing-evidence/source_doc on older rows; new rows fully tagged). Graph regenerated: 95 nodes, 228 edges.
Spreadsheet was NOT open (no lock file); xlsx written directly, no pending CSV needed.

## 2026-06-06 — daily ingest
- Inbox files processed (2): 2026-06-05-1204-x-scan-extract.md, 2026-06-05-2004-x-scan-extract.md (both FACT-grade X-scan extracts).
- New companies added (2): ByteDance (BYTEDANCE, layer 10), SpaceX (Colossus compute) (SPCX, layer 10).
- New edges added (9): MU→NVDA & SAMSUNG→NVDA (supplies HBM, Vera Rubin HBM4); ARM→META/OPENAI/ORCL/BYTEDANCE (licenses CPU IP, Arm AGI-CPU); GOOGL→SPCX & ANTHROPIC→SPCX (runs compute on); NVDA→SPCX (sells GPUs to).
- Strengthened 2 existing edges (untagged→FACT + source_doc): SKHYNIX→NVDA (HBM4 cert), AVGO→GOOGL (TPU commitment). No duplicate rows added.
- Deduped out (2): SKHYNIX→NVDA and AVGO→GOOGL already existed (strengthened instead).
- Validator: errors=0, warnings=184 (PASS). The 5 "flagged" warnings are intentional (?) markers.
- FLAGGED FOR USER REVIEW: the 20:04 extract attributes the "Colossus" compute facilities (Memphis) to SpaceX, but Colossus is commonly associated with xAI. The 3 SPCX edges and the SPCX node carry a "(?)" flag and a warning callout on the page. Verify the SpaceX-vs-xAI attribution and the ~$30B Google / ~$45B Anthropic deal figures against primary sources before relying on them.
- Spreadsheet was NOT open (no lock file); xlsx written directly, no pending CSV.

## 2026-06-07
- Inbox files processed: 2026-06-06-2256-x-scan-extract.md, 2026-06-07-0404-x-scan-extract.md (both pre-extracted FACT-grade x-scan extracts).
- Edges added: 0. All 7 unique candidate edges (AVGO co-designs w/ GOOGL/META/OPENAI/ANTHROPIC; MU/SAMSUNG/SKHYNIX supplies HBM to NVDA) already exist as FACT-grade rows — restatements of the 2026-06-05 x-scan, deduplicated.
- New companies added: 0 (all 9 referenced nodes already present).
- Strengthened 1 existing edge: AVGO|co-designs custom silicon with|META — added source_doc (X-Reports/2026-06-06-2256-x-scan.md) and dated FACT provenance to a previously unsourced "MTIA"-only evidence note. No duplicate row created.
- Validator: errors=0, warnings=182 (PASS). Graph rebuilt: 97 nodes / 237 edges.
- Excel: no lock file found (spreadsheet not open); xlsx write succeeded.
- Flagged for review: existing SAMSUNG|supplies HBM/DRAM to|NVDA edge still carries a NEEDS-REVIEW(?) note (prior Samsung HBM3E qual failures) — unchanged this run; the new x-scan asserts FACT-grade Samsung HBM4 cert, which the separate "supplies HBM to" edge already reflects.

## 2026-06-07 (ingest)
**Inbox files processed:** 15 new files.
**Edges added:** 20 (de-duplicated; ~10 candidate edges skipped as already present). **New companies:** 6.

**New nodes:** SMIC (L3 China foundry), Cambricon (L4 China AI accel), Largan Precision (L7 TW optical), Zhen Ding Technology (L6 TW PCB/substrate), Wiwynn (L9 TW ODM), Camtek (L2 IL inspection).

**Files that yielded new relationships:**

- *Citi — COMPUTEX CPO Ready to Go (2026-06-05):* Foxconn/MediaTek/TSMC/Wiwynn/Largan → CPO; MediaTek co-designs with Ayar Labs.
- *Citi — Zhen Ding (4958.TW) (2026-06-05):* ZDT optical-module PCB → Optical buildout; ABF-substrate supply to MediaTek (FACT-ish) and NVDA/AVGO/QCOM ("in the queue" → VIEW, flagged "(?)").
- *Jefferies — Blayne's Bytes (2026-06-05):* Broadcom drives HBM demand (TPUv8 content); Google → AI Training Capex ($85bn raise); Camtek HBM-inspection orders.
- *Morgan Stanley — Build for Future AI Infrastructure:* MediaTek co-designs Grace CPU with NVIDIA (N1X AI PC); SMIC→Cambricon foundry (VIEW, "(?)"); Cambricon competes with NVIDIA.
- *BofA — NVIDIA CFO Keynote (2026-06-04):* confirms existing NVDA→CPO (Feynman optical scale-up) — no new edge.

**Processed, no new edges (macro / positioning / consumer / narrative, or image-only PDFs):** Asia Technology Outlook (HBM tightness restates existing), Barclays US Economics (jobs), Goldman Sachs US Daily (no Fed cuts), J.P. Morgan Positioning Intelligence, Morgan Stanley Global Macro (payrolls), Bernstein Apple WWDC preview (consumer), 利率问题解读 (rates), 期权解读周五暴跌 (options), Anthropic-vs-OpenAI IPO race (The Information, narrative).

**Notes / flags:**
- Several PDFs were image-only (no text layer); supply-chain-relevant ones OCR'd via tesseract (BofA NVDA, both Citi notes, Jefferies). Macro/consumer image-only PDFs were not OCR'd (no graph value).
- VIEW vs FACT: China-semis beneficiary calls and "ABF clients in queue" stored as VIEW; speculative/pipeline items flagged "(?)".
- NOT in vault but repeatedly named (held back as conservative, no clean single edge): GUC, Alchip, Hua Hong, Piotech, Hygon, Onto, Cohu, Unimicron.
- Spreadsheet was NOT open (no lock file); xlsx written directly.

**Validator:** errors=0, warnings=182 (pre-existing categories: source_doc/evidence missing on legacy rows). Graph: 103 nodes, 257 edges. PASS.

- **New edges added (10):**
  - HITACHI partners with INTC (FACT, x-scan).
  - NVDA sells GPUs to AAPL; AAPL runs compute on GOOGL; AAPL partners with GOOGL (FACT, x-scan — Apple PCC on Google Cloud Nvidia GPUs; Gemini-based Foundation Models).
  - CBRS benefits from T_INFER (VIEW, MS, PT $250 OW); CBRS competes with NVDA (VIEW, MS).

  - SMCI builds AI servers for XAI (VIEW, TMTB/Bluefin via X — reported ~1,500-rack/$5B+ award; flagged "(?)").
- **De-dup:** x-scan rows "NVDA sells GPUs to GOOGL" and "TXN benefits from T_POWER" already existed → skipped.
- **Validator:** errors=0, warnings=182 (all pre-existing: source_doc/evidence missing on legacy rows). PASS. Graph = 109 nodes / 270 edges.
- **Flagged for user review:**
  - SMCI→xAI award is sourced from "Bluefin via X" (social/secondary) — tagged VIEW + "(?)", verify against a primary source.
  - Memory-shortage cluster (MS/CITI/Nomura) all corroborate NVIDIA cutting Vera Rubin SoCAMM2/LPDDR5X from 192GB→96GB modules (55TB→28TB per rack) due to DRAM shortage; suppliers reportedly filling only ~60% of SoCAMM2 demand; CMX/NAND demand rising. No new edges added (reinforces existing MU/Samsung/SK Hynix → NVDA memory + T_HBM); consider strengthening those evidence notes manually.
  - "Rubin深度+AI+PCB报告" names Chinese PCB/CCL beneficiaries (沪电/胜宏/生益 Shengyi, copper foil 隆扬+三井/Mitsui, Q-Glass) as Rubin NVL144 winners — NOT ingested as nodes/edges due to low source quality (garbled retail infographic). Recommend a primary-sourced pass if you want these added.

## 2026-06-10 — daily ingest

Inbox files processed (3):
- 2026-06-09-1204-x-scan-extract.md
- 2026-06-09-2004-x-scan-extract.md
- Semianalysis 原文- Powered Down, Lights Off. 800VDC Pushout and CPO Delays.pdf (image-only PDF; OCR'd via tesseract)

Changes:
- New companies (3): HANMI (Hanmi Semiconductor, equip/TC bonders), APH (Amphenol, copper interconnect), FORM (FormFactor, test/probe).
- New edges (7): HUAWEI→T_CHINA (FACT, $295B China DC buildout); HANMI→SKHYNIX supplies HBM bonding equipment (FACT, ₩44.2B HBM4 TC-bonder order); AAPL runs compute on NVDA (FACT, PCC on NVDA GPUs via Google Cloud); SMCI→T_INFER (FACT, ~$39B order book); APH→T_NET (VIEW, SemiAnalysis); FORM→T_CPO (VIEW, SemiAnalysis); TER→T_CPO (VIEW, SemiAnalysis).
- Evidence strengthened (2): LITE→T_CPO (added FACT CPO order + SemiAnalysis timing caution); VRT→T_POWER (was empty; SemiAnalysis 800VDC-pushout view).
- Skipped as duplicates: AAPL→GOOGL runs compute on, NVDA→GOOGL sells GPUs to, MU/SKHYNIX/SAMSUNG→NVDA supplies HBM to, LITE→NVDA optical, SKHYNIX→T_HBM, LITE→T_CPO (strengthened instead).
- Wiki: 3 new pages (Hanmi Semiconductor, Amphenol, FormFactor); additive bullets on Huawei, SK Hynix, Apple, Supermicro, Teradyne, Lumentum, Vertiv + Themes (China Indigenous AI Buildout, AI Inference Demand, CPO, Optical & Networking Buildout, HBM Demand, Datacenter Power Demand).
- Notable VIEWs not graphed (logged only): SemiAnalysis negative on LITE/COHR/HIMX/AAOI (CPO timing), WOLF/NVTS (800VDC pushout removes near-term WBG catalyst) — negative sentiment has no edge type; captured in theme/company notes.
- Validator: nodes=113 edges=278 errors=0 warnings=181 (pre-existing coverage gaps: source_doc/evidence missing on older rows). Graph regenerated.
- Excel not open; xlsx written directly. (Note: this run completed a 2026-06-09 ingest that was interrupted before regenerate/record; no double-writes — dedupe guard verified.)

## 2026-06-10 — Narrative Atlas added as source (user request)

New source: https://narrative-graph.onrender.com/feed (Narrative Atlas — daily per-ticker analyst-narrative digests).
Dedupe mechanism: _tools/narrative_atlas_state.json — every feed event gets key sha1(date|ticker|stance|summary[:120])[:16]; only events whose key is absent from "seen" are processed; the feed has no working server-side date filter (?from/?to ignored), so dedupe is client-side. State initialized with all 252 currently-visible events; events ≤2026-06-09 marked seen WITHOUT ingestion (historical backfill deliberately skipped to avoid stale/duplicate narratives).

From today's 31 events (2026-06-10):
- New companies (3): CIEN (Ciena, optical L7), IFX (Infineon, power semis L13 — judgment call, no analog/power-semi layer exists), FLEX (Flex, EMS/DC power L9).
- New edges (7, all VIEW): STM→T_NET (BofA upgrade, AI optical); AMAT/LRCX/KLAC→T_TRAIN (Barclays semicap capex); IFX→T_POWER (Jefferies, 800V pushout neutral/positive — corroborates SemiAnalysis); FLEX→T_POWER (JPM); CIEN→T_NET (JPM).
- Skipped as duplicates/restatements: SMCI $39B orders (already FACT from x-scan), TSM May rev, ANET→T_NET, NBIS→T_INFER, BE→T_POWER.
- Skipped as out-of-scope/uncertain: software-sentiment items (SNOW/TWLO/MDB/FROG/DDOG/NET/ZS/RDDT/NFLX/HOOD/CHWY/APP/DASH), META layoffs, AMZN freight, SKHYNIX supplier-pricing (vague), OPENAI 10GW Ohio DC w/ possible NVDA backing (negotiation-stage, not graphed), PSTG (single sentiment, node sprawl).
- Validator: nodes=116 edges=285 errors=0 warnings=181. Graph regenerated.

## 2026-06-10 (evening run)
- Inbox files processed: 18 (3 x-scan extracts 06-10, MS Siemens Energy, MS 800V, MS CPO, MS chipflation, MS memory "Healthy Reset", JPM MLCC/Sinocera fireside, Citi ORCL F4Q26 results, DB ORCL preview (OCR), Jefferies ORCL (OCR), DB SIA digest (OCR), TMTB morning(20)+EOD(1), BofA flows, 2x ZeroHedge ETF pieces)
- Narrative Atlas: 252 events visible, 0 new (all previously seen); state last_run updated.
- Nodes added: 5 — ENR (Siemens Energy, L14), DELTA (Delta Electronics, L13), SINOCERA (Sinocera 300285.SZ, L2 materials), ASE (ASE Technology, L6), FOCI (3363.TWO, L7).
- Edges added: 8 — ENR→T_POWER (VIEW MS); DELTA→T_POWER (VIEW MS, 800VDC racks 4Q26); SINOCERA→T_TRAIN (FACT JPM); SINOCERA supplies MLCC powder to SAMSUNG (FACT JPM, flagged (?) — actual customer likely Samsung Electro-Mechanics, not Electronics); ASE→T_CPO (VIEW MS); FOCI→T_CPO (VIEW MS); ORCL→T_INFER (FACT Citi, RPO $638B); BE supplies fuel-cell power to ORCL (FACT Jefferies).
- Evidence strengthened: TSM→T_CPO (+ PIC capacity 10kwpm 1Q27, MS 2026-06-10).
- Restatements skipped (already in graph): x-scan 06-10 edges (SKHYNIX/SAMSUNG/MU HBM→NVDA, NVDA→T_CPO, AVGO↔GOOGL, TSM→GOOGL/T_TRAIN); SMCI $39B orders; STM optical/CPO.
- Skipped, no supply-chain mechanism: BofA flow trends, 2x ZeroHedge ETF/positioning pieces, MS chipflation + memory decks (macro/cycle context, no new company relationships), DB SIA digest (industry stats), DB ORCL preview (restates OCI story), TMTB wraps (sentiment).
- Validator: errors=0, warnings=181 (legacy evidence/source gaps). Graph regenerated: 121 nodes / 293 edges.
- Excel was NOT open (no lock file); xlsx written directly.

## 2026-06-11 (scheduled run)

**Inbox files processed (10):** TMTB EOD Wrap/ADBE First Take; x-scan extracts 06-11 0404 & 2004; CPU.pdf (BofA agentic-CPU TAM $170bn); Intel double upgrade.pdf (BofA); Oppenheimer-SpaceX.pdf (IPO initiation); TACO Thursday ZeroHedge (macro only — no edges); TMTB Morning Wrap (21); 旭创.pdf (BofA Zhongji Innolight); 英特尔应筹集资金 (SemiAnalysis Intel capital raise).

**Narrative Atlas:** 240 events visible, 45 new. 6 graphed (WDC, STX, INTC, ARM, WOLF, NVTS). ~14 were restatements of existing edges (MU, SNDK, LITE, COHR, CRWV, BE, ORCL, STM, IFX, SMCI, SPCX, AMD — no duplicate rows added). ~25 skipped as off-topic: software/app sentiment (PANW, CRWD, DDOG, DASH, EPAM, ACN), consumer/e-commerce (NFLX, MELI, ETSY, EBAY, CVNA, DUOL, SPOT, HOOD, META ads, AMZN freight), price-move chatter without mechanism (ASML/AMAT, GOOGL, AVGO, TSEM, VRSN, NVDA generic, TSLA SpaceX-IPO sentiment).

**Added:** 7 nodes (WDC Western Digital, STX Seagate, WOLF Wolfspeed, NVTS Navitas, TSLA Tesla, INNOLIGHT Zhongji Innolight, TSEM Tower Semiconductor) and 16 edges. Evidence upgraded on 2 existing edges: MU→T_HBM (FACT: 2026 HBM capacity sold out, binding contracts), LITE→T_NET (FACT: capacity fully booked through 2028).

**Notable FACT edges:** SPCX acquired XAI ($250B, early 2026); Terafab chip-manufacturing JV SpaceX/Tesla/Intel (1TW/yr goal); AVGO+Apollo+Blackstone 20GW datacenter platform; CDNS 14A IP for INTC; NVDA strategic investment in INTC; Innolight deep Google relationship (>40% 1.6T share); Tower Semi $1.3bn SiPho 2027 contracts.

**Flagged / skipped with reasons:**
- GOOGL→Samsung TPU-v10 capacity + MediaTek design (The Information via TMTB): rumored & disputed in TMTB Slack — NOT graphed.
- SpaceX agreement to acquire Cursor: pending deal, app-layer — not graphed (noted only).
- WOLF/NVTS edges are strength-1 VIEW with (?) — 800VDC timing dispute (SemiAnalysis pushout vs JPM/Jefferies pushback).
- TACO Thursday ZeroHedge: macro-only, no supply-chain content.
- Oracle "four AI infra contracts" in TMTB(21): counterparties not legible in PDF extraction — no edge.

**Validator:** nodes=128 edges=309 errors=0 warnings=179 (legacy source_doc/evidence gaps) — PASS. Graph regenerated (update_graph.py).

**Excel:** no lock file detected; xlsx write succeeded directly.

## 2026-06-11 (second run)
- Inbox: no new files (all 145 supported files already in ingested.json).
- Narrative Atlas: 242 events visible; 4 new keys, all dated 2026-06-02 (stragglers from the pre-2026-06-10 backfill window). 0 graphed / 4 skipped: SNOW Bull and MU Bear had empty summaries; SNDK Bear (SK Hynix capacity-doubling price recap) and MRVL Mixed (NVDA CEO sentiment) are price/sentiment recaps with no new supply-chain mechanism beyond existing coverage. Note: events with empty summaries break the documented feed regex (it spans into the next block) — both artifact keys and correct block-parse keys were added to 'seen' to prevent reprocessing.
- Edges added: 0. New companies: 0. Spreadsheet untouched; no graph regeneration or validation needed.

## 2026-06-12 (scheduled ingest)
**Inbox files processed (2):** 2026-06-12-0404-x-scan-extract.md, 2026-06-12-1204-x-scan-extract.md (both FACT-grade x-scan extracts).
**Narrative Atlas:** 187 events visible; 28 new (all 2026-06-11 wrap); **0 graphed**. Skip reasons: AMAT/ASML/LRCX "memory/AI WFE" thesis = restatement of existing `benefits from [[AI Training Capex]]` edges (dup); SNDK server-DRAM-price item has no clean theme (T_HBM is HBM-specific; SNDK→T_INFER already covers AI storage); STM driven by SpaceX/SPCX-IPO sentiment, no clean supply-chain edge; ORCL = bear rating/margin-concern note, no new edge; AVGO contained a *rumored* GOOGL→Samsung TPU10 (2028) + Google/MediaTek design item — skipped per rumored/negotiation-stage rule; CRDO/ALAB "new highs + CPO-pushback bid" are price-action/sentiment and the CPO-delay mechanism is the inverse of the T_CPO theme (would mislead); remainder = generic software/consumer/financials sentiment. All 187 visible keys marked seen.
**Edges added (2):** QUANTA `assembles AI systems for` NVDA (str 2); WISTRON `assembles AI systems for` NVDA (str 2). Verb normalized to existing FOXCONN→NVDA vocabulary ("assembles AI systems for") rather than the extract's "supplies server assembly to".
**New companies added (2):** Quanta Computer (2382.TW, layer 9 Servers & ODM/OEM, Taiwan); Wistron (3231.TW, layer 9 Servers & ODM/OEM, Taiwan).
**Edges enriched (additive, not duplicated):** FOXCONN→NVDA assembly note extended to Vera Rubin NVL72; TSM→MRVL evidence + strength 2→3 (Teralynx T100 102.4Tbps on TSMC 3nm); SKHYNIX/SAMSUNG/MU `supplies HBM to` NVDA evidence appended HBM4 full-prod cert allocation split (~60-70% / ~25-30% / remainder).
**Restated/skipped (no new row):** SKHYNIX/SAMSUNG/MU `supplies HBM4 to` NVDA (dup-in-spirit of existing `supplies HBM to`); AVGO `co-designs custom silicon with` GOOGL/META/OPENAI/ANTHROPIC (all already present); FOXCONN→NVDA (existing edge enriched).
**Validator:** errors=0, warnings=178 (all pre-existing: source_doc/evidence-missing on legacy rows; new rows are FACT-tagged w/ source_doc). Graph regenerated: 130 nodes, 311 edges.
**For user review:** none flagged from this run. Excel was NOT open (no lock file).

## 2026-06-13 (scheduled ingest)
**Inbox files processed (5):**
- `2026-06-13-0404-x-scan-extract.md` — 1 FACT edge: INTC manufactures chips for GOOGL (>3M custom TPUs ordered, 2028 build; Intel as Google's AI-chip contract manufacturer). NEW.
- `2026-06-13-2005-x-scan-extract.md` — 2 FACT edges: TSM partners with NVDA (TSMC adopting NVIDIA accelerated computing/CUDA-X across design+fab) → NEW; SKHYNIX partners with NVDA → already existed (2026-06-08), evidence note strengthened with fab-design/Omniverse extension.
- `UBS-Global I O Semiconductors：Cycle Update…US$2.4tn by 2027-260609.pdf` — image-only PDF, OCR'd (pdftoppm 140dpi + tesseract). Macro cycle/valuation report; reiterates memory-shortage & broad AI semis thesis. No new edges — strengthened evidence on existing T_HBM edges (SKHYNIX/MU/SAMSUNG) with UBS corroboration.
- `UBS-…WFE Update：Early Innings of Supercycle，’28 WFE ~$250B-260609.pdf` — image-only PDF, OCR'd. WFE supercycle (~$198B '27 / ~$247.5B '28); ASML litho not a constraint. No new edges — strengthened existing T_TRAIN edges (AMAT/LRCX/KLAC/ASML) with UBS corroboration.
- `US_Equities_Weekly_Rundown_6-12-26.pdf` — Goldman Prime Brokerage positioning/flows note. SKIPPED for graphing (positioning/sentiment/flows; no company→company or company→theme supply-chain mechanism). Marked ingested so it is not reprocessed.

**Narrative Atlas feed:** fetched OK. 187 events visible, max date 2026-06-11; all already in `seen` → **0 new events** (feed not refreshed past 2026-06-11 since prior 2026-06-12 run). state last_run→2026-06-13, last_event_date=2026-06-11.

**Edges added:** 2 (INTC→GOOGL manufactures chips for; TSM→NVDA partners with). **New companies added:** 0. **Evidence-strengthened (existing rows):** 8 (SKHYNIX→NVDA partners with; AMAT/LRCX/KLAC/ASML benefits from T_TRAIN; SKHYNIX/MU/SAMSUNG benefits from T_HBM).

**Validator:** errors=0, warnings=178 (96 source_doc missing, 61 evidence missing, 16 evidence untagged, 5 flagged — all pre-existing on older rows). Graph: 130 nodes / 313 edges. PASS.

**Notes/flags:** Both UBS reports were image-only and required OCR; treated as analyst VIEW (forecasts/ratings) per Analyst Report Extraction prompt — no new FACT supply edges asserted from them, only theme-VIEW corroboration. Goldman positioning note intentionally not graphed. No EDGAR pull (disabled). Excel was closed (no lock file) — xlsx written directly.

## 2026-06-14 (ingest)
**Inbox:** 12 new files processed.
- Graphed: CITI Texas Power field trip → new node **NRG Energy** (L14) + `NRG→benefits from→T_POWER`. JPM KLAC → `KLAC→benefits from→T_COWOS` (process-control gatekeeper, advanced-packaging inspection). JPM Samsung Electro-Mechanics → new node **SEMCO** (009150.KS, L6) + new theme **T_MLCC "AI Server MLCC Demand"**; `SEMCO→benefits from→T_MLCC` and `→T_TRAIN`. JPM Asian MLCC Industry → `SINOCERA→benefits from→T_MLCC`.
- Confirms-existing / no new edges: Global Memory Tech (memory shortage already captured under T_HBM); 2× X-scan extracts 2026-06-14 (HBM4 Vera-Rubin certs for SKHYNIX/MU/SAMSUNG + NVDA↔TSMC + SKHYNIX↔NVDA already in graph from 06-05/06-08/06-13).
- Skipped (no graphable AI supply-chain relationship): Deutsche Bank "AI bottlenecks" (event INVITATION only, no content); UBS "Token Costs" (enterprise inference-cost sentiment); BofA "End of token-maxxing" (European macro strategy); Korean leveraged-ETF/gamma note (macro flows); 资金流 fund-flows (macro positioning).

**Narrative Atlas feed:** 32 new events (28×2026-06-12, 3×06-11, 1×06-08). Graphed 4: `TER→benefits from→T_HBM` (memory test demand, JPM), `NOK→benefits from→T_NET` (new node **Nokia** L8, JPM), `ANET→supplies switches to→ANTHROPIC` (Evercore ISI, ?), `QCOM→supplies AI accelerators to→AMZN` (Wells Fargo, speculative ?). Skipped 28: index-inclusion/sentiment (NBIS, CRWV, ALAB, META, AMZN, GOOGL), software/app/e-commerce (ZG, U, SHOP, ROKU, GTLB, ETSY, DASH, CRM, APP, ABNB, ADBE), governance/mention (MRVL CFO, UBER/Waymo, RKLB), and confirms-existing (MU/ARM memory restatements; NVDA China/Vera mixed; COHR/AMD already covered; STM/SPCX = already-ingested Oppenheimer initiation).

**Applied:** 4 new nodes (T_MLCC, SEMCO, NOK, NRG), 9 new edges. Wiki: 4 new pages + 12 additive page edits.
**Validator:** errors=0, warnings=178 (all pre-existing: source_doc/evidence coverage on legacy rows). PASS.
**Flags for review:** ANET→Anthropic and QCOM→AWS are analyst VIEWs (tagged, with "(?)"). T_MLCC is a newly introduced theme; Murata/TDK/Taiyo Yuden/Yageo named as leaders but not added as nodes (noted in theme page) to limit sprawl.

## 2026-06-15 (ingest)
**Inbox:** 35 new files processed.
- **GRAPHED (new theme + nodes):** New theme **T_PCB "AI PCB & CCL Demand"** (multi-sourced: Jefferies-Shengyi, JPM Asia Passives/PCB/CCL, NPO/CCL expert call, GFHK). New nodes: **SHENGYI** (Shengyi Tech 600183, CCL), **EMC** (Elite Material 2383.TW, high-end CCL), **YAGEO** (2327.TW, MLCC/passives), **UNIMICRON** (3037.TW, ABF substrate), **CHROMA** (Chroma ATE 2360.TW, SLT/CPO/power test), **ADVANTEST** (6857.T, ATE/test), **BESI** (BE Semiconductor / Besi BESI.AS, advanced-packaging equip — distinct from Bloom Energy "BE"), **ON** (onsemi, SiC power), **WULF** (TeraWulf, AI/HPC neocloud).

- **Confirms-existing / no new edges:** 3× X-scan extracts 2026-06-15 (HBM4 Vera-Rubin certs SKHYNIX/SAMSUNG/MU + AVGO custom silicon GOOGL/META/OPENAI/ANTHROPIC + INTC→GOOGL — all already in graph); Bernstein Kioxia (NAND); Semianalysis SMIC N+3 (SMIC→Huawei); GFHK-Marvell (MRVL ASIC/optics restated); memory-demand note (TrendForce); MS硬件 & 大摩 semi (corroborate Unimicron/Yageo/ALAB scale-up/800V).
- **Skipped (no graphable AI supply-chain relationship):** CITI Inference "Bridging the Gaps" (AI-model/market color); Jefferies-China AI & Fable 5 Best Ideas (frontier-model intelligence/pricing, no supply chain); Goldman Tesla 2Q deliveries (auto); ZeroHedge×3 (Hartnett, Tech-99th-pct, Hormuz/geopolitics); Flows&Positioning, Jefferies-flow, 亚洲5张图, 资金流-type macro; 沃什FOMC前瞻 & 让加息子弹飞 (Fed/macro); GFHK June (sector strategy); TMTB EOD/Morning wraps (daily market commentary); MPO产业链 & 半导体硅片涨价 expert calls (industry pricing color — many private/non-scope component names, avoided node sprawl); 算力租赁纪要 (China policy/macro on national compute network).

**Narrative Atlas feed:** fetched OK (feed refreshed to "as of 2026-06-16"). Adapted parser to the saved-text layout (no "daily"/"· slot" tokens). 230 events visible; 33 new (all 2026-06-15). Graphed 4: NVDA→T_POWER (Vera Rubin 800V HVDC), ON→T_POWER (new node, Citi), WULF→T_POWER (new node, BofA), ALAB→AMD (Northland, ?). Skipped 29: AI-referred-traffic/consumer (ZILLOW, WAYFAIR, FACEBOOK, PINTEREST/PINS, REDDIT, SPOTIFY, AMZN retail, BKNG, CPNG), software/IT-services (ACN, IT, IBM, DDOG, DT, NOW, MSFT Copilot), governance/M&A-rumor (ANTHROPIC offline, META morale, ROKU/Fox), and confirms-existing memory/storage restatements (MU, WDC, STX, HDDS, NBIS market-wrap, GOOGL Gemini, ORCL, TXN). All 33 new keys added to seen (363→396); last_event_date=2026-06-15.

**Applied:** 1 new theme + 9 new company nodes; 21 new edges. Wiki: 10 new pages + additive dated sections on 9 existing pages (NVIDIA, Lumentum, Coherent, Corning, AMD; themes CoWoS, HBM, AI Training, CPO, Datacenter Power, MLCC).
**Validator:** errors=0, warnings=178 (all pre-existing: source_doc/evidence/tag coverage on legacy rows — no new warnings). Graph: 144 nodes / 343 edges. PASS.
**Flags for review:** (1) NVDA "invests in" LITE/COHR/GLW asserted by Morgan Stanley as established premise — tagged FACT w/ firm+date, but not independently corroborated (verify against primary source/filing). (2) SHENGYI→NVDA and ALAB→AMD are analyst VIEWs marked "(?)". (3) Many AI-passives/CCL leaders named but not added as nodes to limit sprawl (Murata, Taiyo Yuden, Kingboard, Ibiden, Shinko, Nan Ya PCB, Victory Giant, Tripod, Accton, UMC, Tianfu, US Conec/Senko). (4) Besi node id is "BESI" (Bloom Energy keeps "BE"). Excel was closed (no lock) — xlsx written directly.

## 2026-06-16 (ingest)
**Inbox:** 2 new files processed (both X-scan FACT-only extracts): `2026-06-16-0404-x-scan-extract.md`, `2026-06-16-1204-x-scan-extract.md`. 10 candidate edges evaluated.
- **GRAPHED (1 new edge):** `TSM → manufactures chips for → SKHYNIX` (FACT, X-scan 2026-06-16): TSMC 3nm logic base die used in SK Hynix 12-layer HBM4E; HBM4 base-die partnership (Chey–C.C. Wei, 6/3). No new nodes (all existed).
- **STRENGTHENED existing edges (evidence appended, no new rows):** (1) `MRVL→co-designs custom silicon with→GOOGL` — prior VIEW (Funda-AI) upgraded with FACT X-scan corroboration (Marvell custom-ASIC/XPU program names Alphabet). (2) `BE→supplies on-site fuel-cell power to→ORCL` — added quantum "up to 2.8 GW". (3) `BE→supplies on-site fuel-cell power to→NBIS` — added "~$2.6B / 328 MW".
- **SKIPPED as confirms-existing / semantic duplicates (6):** `SKHYNIX→NVDA` ("supplies … to" — already have `supplies HBM to NVDA` + `partners with`); `SKHYNIX/SAMSUNG/MU → supplies HBM to → NVDA` (HBM4 Vera-Rubin certs already in graph since 2026-06-05); `MRVL→AMZN` (already `supplies optical DSP/silicon to AMZN`, XPU noted); `MRVL→MSFT` (already `supplies custom silicon to MSFT`, "co-designs Maia" in evidence).

**Narrative Atlas feed:** fetched OK (page "as of 2026-06-16"). 230 events visible (06-08→06-15); **0 new** — all keys already in seen (no 2026-06-16 events published yet; newest = 2026-06-15, processed last run). seen unchanged at 396; last_run→2026-06-16, last_event_date=2026-06-15.

**Applied:** 0 new nodes; 1 new edge; 3 evidence strengthenings. Wiki: additive dated sections on 4 pages (TSMC, SK Hynix, Marvell, Bloom Energy).
**Validator:** errors=0, warnings=178 (all pre-existing: source_doc/evidence/tag coverage on legacy rows — no new warnings). Graph: 144 nodes / 343→344 edges. PASS.
**Flags for review:** (1) MRVL→GOOGL custom-silicon now carries both the original IPU-networking VIEW and the new XPU FACT — claims are adjacent but not identical; verify scope against primary source. (2) New TSM→SKHYNIX base-die edge sourced to fallback X-scan (X was logged out → reputable trade press via WebSearch, per extract header), not an X post — durable relationship, but confirm against TSMC/SK Hynix primary disclosure. Excel was closed (no lock) — xlsx written directly.

## 2026-06-17 (scheduled ingest)
- **Inbox files processed (6):** "Global Strategy Paper_ The Post Modern Cycle – Navigating the Capex Boom.pdf" (GS macro — capex supercycle theme; no specific supply-chain edges, skipped for edges), "MS 上调村田 MLCC.pdf" + "大摩-电子元器件MLCC.pdf" (MS Japan electronic components — Murata/Taiyo Yuden/Ibiden), "SemiA … RL Systems Mind the Gap …" (RL training infra/TCO; diffuse, reinforces AI Training Capex but no clean new company edge — skipped), "英特尔 18A-P … Intel 18A-P Enters Risk Production …" (two identical copies — process milestone; Apple-as-customer is speculation only, flagged not graphed).
- **Narrative Atlas feed:** 228 events visible (dates 06-08→06-15); 24 new (all 2026-06-15). Graphed: 0 net-new edges. WDC & STX MS PT-raise events deduped to existing `benefits from T_INFER` edges → evidence strengthened with MS 06-15 corroboration. SNDK event was Mixed/cautionary → no change. Remaining ~21 skipped (consumer/travel/software/adtech sentiment: UBER/EXPE/BKNG/ABNB/RDDT/PINS/DASH/SNOW/MDB/APP/META/AMZN/GOOGL; and vague price-action mentions w/ no mechanism: AMAT/LRCX/AVGO/LITE/GLW/CIEN/QCOM/SPCX).
- **Nodes added (3):** MURATA (Murata Manufacturing, 6981.T, L6), TAIYOYUDEN (Taiyo Yuden, 6976.T, L6), IBIDEN (Ibiden, 4062.T, L6).
- **Edges added (4):** MURATA→T_MLCC (benefits from, str3, VIEW MS 06-16); TAIYOYUDEN→T_MLCC (benefits from, str2, VIEW MS 06-16); IBIDEN→NVDA (supplies package substrate to, str2, VIEW MS 06-16); IBIDEN→INTC (supplies package substrate to, str2, VIEW MS 06-16). Plus 2 existing edges (WDC, STX) evidence-strengthened.
- **Wiki:** created Companies/Murata Manufacturing.md, Taiyo Yuden.md, Ibiden.md; appended dated sections to Themes/AI Server MLCC Demand.md, Companies/NVIDIA.md, Companies/Intel.md.
- **Validator:** errors=0, warnings=178 (all pre-existing: source_doc/evidence coverage, 5 flagged). Graph regenerated: 147 nodes, 348 edges. EDGAR pull DISABLED (sec.gov unreachable) — edgar manifest untouched.
- **Flagged for review:** all 4 new edges are analyst VIEWs (MS forecasts), not confirmed facts. Intel↔Apple 18A-P foundry relationship deliberately NOT graphed (speculation). Excel was not open (no lock file).

## 2026-06-17 (scheduled ingest — re-run, no-op)
- **Inbox:** 0 new files (all 202 inbox files already in ingested.json).
- **Narrative Atlas feed:** fetched OK (page "as of 2026-06-17"); 229 events visible (06-08→06-15, newest=06-15). 0 genuinely-new events. One differing key parsed (PANW 2026-06-08 Bull) is a **truncation artifact** — the web_fetch capture cut the page mid-event ("Palo Al…"), producing a different hash than the full PANW 06-08 event already in seen (`24cb026a3c274be5`). Not a new event; not graphed (PANW = cybersecurity software, no AI supply-chain hardware mechanism → skip per extraction rules regardless). Phantom key deliberately NOT added to seen to avoid state pollution; seen unchanged at 420.
- **Context:** today's primary 2026-06-17 run already completed earlier (full section above: +3 nodes MURATA/TAIYOYUDEN/IBIDEN, +4 edges, graph 147 nodes/348 edges). This invocation is a duplicate same-day trigger.
- **Applied:** 0 nodes, 0 edges, 0 wiki edits. xlsx/wiki/graph untouched. ingested.json + narrative_atlas_state.json unchanged.
- **Validator (read-only health check):** nodes=147 edges=348 errors=0 warnings=178 (all pre-existing). PASS. EDGAR pull DISABLED (sec.gov unreachable) — edgar manifest untouched.

## 2026-06-19 (ingest)
**Inbox:** 20 new files processed. Edge-yielding: 5 x-scan extracts (2026-06-18 ×3, 2026-06-19 ×2), Bernstein "CPU Renaissance $223bn TAM" (06-17), JPM Broadcom "Ignore the Noise / TPU on track" (06-16), CoreWeave–Key Context exec interview (06-17). Skimmed, no NEW edges (macro/sentiment or duplicative of existing themes/edges): both TMTB wraps (EOD + morning), BofA Global Memory Weekly (corroborates HBM/memory shortage — edges already present), Semianalysis "2026 US DC Capacity Is Not Canceled" (macro/power), Bernstein QCOM/Tenstorrent (rumored M&A — not graphed; ARM→QCOM already exists), "Let's Talk About Kevin" FOMC preview (macro). Image-only PDFs not OCR'd this run (left for review): Bernstein SOCAMM2, UBS Soitec downgrade, CITI Han's Laser, UBS China IDC, UBS SemiBytes, 半导体设备.
**Narrative Atlas feed:** 236 events parsed; 120 new (2026-06-16/17/18). Graphed 5 (TLN, JBL, HPE, AMAT/LRCX/KLAC→T_HBM via Citi, INTC–AAPL rumor, SPCX→GOOGL); the rest skipped as price-action/app-software sentiment, ratings reprices without a supply-chain mechanism, or duplicates of existing edges. NOTE: the feed's actual markup omits the documented "daily" frequency line and "· slot" suffix; parser adapted accordingly (key formula unchanged).
**Added:** 5 nodes — companies TLN (Talen Energy, L14), JBL (Jabil, L9), RXT (Rackspace Technology, L10), HYGON (Hygon, L4); + new theme T_CPU "Server CPU & Agentic AI Demand" (L0). 21 edges (0 dups in final set).
  - Power: TLN→T_POWER. Capex: JBL→T_TRAIN. Networking: HPE→T_NET. Memory equip: AMAT/LRCX/KLAC→T_HBM (Citi WFE, NAND cycle — note: HBM theme used as memory-demand proxy). CPU: ARM(3)/AMD/INTC/HYGON→T_CPU; HYGON→T_CHINA. Foundry: TSM→MU (Micron HBM4E base-die at TSMC, FACT). Cloud: AMD→RXT (FACT), CRWV→OPENAI/ANTHROPIC/MSFT/META (FACT), SPCX→GOOGL runs-compute-on (FACT). ASIC: AVGO→AAPL, AVGO→SAMBANOVA (FACT, JPM).
**Flags / review:** INTC→AAPL "manufactures chips for" is a RUMOR (Trump remark via feed) — strength 1, tagged VIEW with (?). AVGO co-designs with Apple/SambaNova are JPM analyst assertions tagged FACT. CRWV customer list is from a primary-source exec interview (Google omitted as a CRWV customer out of caution). Tenstorrent acquisition (QCOM) deliberately NOT graphed (rumored, unclosed).
**Validator:** nodes=152 edges=369 errors=0 warnings=178 (PASS). Warnings are pre-existing legacy-row categories (source_doc/evidence missing on old rows); all new rows fully tagged. Excel was CLOSED (no lock file) — xlsx written directly, no pending CSV.

## 2026-06-20 (scheduled ingest)
- **Inbox files processed (3):** 2026-06-20-0404-x-scan-extract.md, 2026-06-20-1204-x-scan-extract.md, 2026-06-20-2004-x-scan-extract.md (all FACT-grade x-scan extracts; 11 edge rows, 6 unique source→rel→target tuples).
- **Narrative Atlas feed:** fetched OK; 237 visible events (dates 06-11 → 06-18). 0 new (all keys already in seen=540). last_run→2026-06-20, last_event_date=2026-06-18.
- **New edges added:** 0 — all 6 candidate HBM edges already exist in the Edges sheet.
- **Edges strengthened (evidence/as_of, no new rows):** 6 —
  MU/SKHYNIX/SAMSUNG ⟶ supplies HBM to ⟶ NVDA, and MU/SKHYNIX/SAMSUNG ⟶ benefits from ⟶ T_HBM.
  New FACTs folded in: NVDA requested 16-Hi HBM4 (H2'26, Q4 delivery) from all three makers; SK Hynix shipped 12-layer HBM4E samples ~Jun 18 ahead of schedule (sole HBM4E requester = NVDA, for Rubin Ultra 384GB/GPU); Micron met Rubin HBM4 spec + final customer samples; Samsung HBM4E samples May 29 + ~50% capacity scaling. as_of bumped to 2026-06-20; filled 2 previously-empty source_doc cells (MU & SAMSUNG benefits-from-T_HBM).
- **New companies added:** 0 (MU, SKHYNIX, SAMSUNG, NVDA, T_HBM all pre-existing).
- **Wiki updated:** dated 2026-06-20 sections appended (additive) to Themes/HBM Demand.md, Companies/{SK Hynix, Micron, Samsung Electronics, NVIDIA}.md.
- **Regenerate:** update_graph.py → 152 nodes, 369 edges (edge count unchanged = no dup rows). 
- **Validator:** errors=0, warnings=175 (93 source_doc missing, 61 evidence missing, 16 untagged, 5 flagged — pre-existing baseline). PASS.
- **Notes:** VIEW/unverified items in source reports (analyst PTs, Leopold positioning, Trump revenue estimates, anomalous MU price level) were excluded by the upstream x-scan extracts. Excel not open (no lock file); xlsx written directly. Backup saved to _tools/backup_pre_0620.xlsx.

- ZHIPU→T_CHINA (VIEW) / →T_INFER (VIEW)

**Validator:** errors=0, warnings=175 — PASS (nodes=158, edges=389). Graph + START HERE + Degree sheet regenerated. Excel was not open; xlsx written directly (no pending CSV).

**Skipped / flagged for review:**
- Macro/flows/positioning files (Goldman/DB/BofA flows, ZeroHedge, JPM AI Capex financing) — no supply-chain edges.
- Heavy node-sprawl avoidance: numerous Chinese A-share glass (力诺/美迪凯/帝尔激光/沃格/天承/旗滨/凯盛/汇成真空…), PCB (建滔/胜宏/沪电/鹏鼎/中钨高新/鼎泰…), power-semi (新洁能/英诺赛科…), and optical-chip (源杰/长光华芯…) names NOT added — speculative/one-off recommendations.
- ByteDance domestic-GPU procurement (Enflame/Kunlun + Huawei/Cambricon/Hygon) NOT graphed as company edges — noisy ASR salon, partly negotiation-stage; covered thematically via existing *→T_CHINA edges.
- Watermark-scrambled PDFs (Bernstein gas-turbine stack, Bernstein Intel, DB Global Memory, MS Greater China Power Semis, Fujikura, Advantest body) not OCR'd; Advantest edges derived from explicit report title; gas-turbine/Fujikura yielded no new nodes (GEV/ENR already benefit from T_POWER).
- VIEW vs FACT discipline applied throughout (analyst forecasts/PTs tagged VIEW; stated supply facts tagged FACT).

## 2026-06-22 (scheduled ingest)

**Inbox files processed (2):** 2026-06-22-1204-x-scan-extract.md, 2026-06-22-2004-x-scan-extract.md (FACT-grade X-scan extracts).

**Narrative Atlas feed:** 245 events visible; 28 new vs state (1×2026-06-11 META, 27×2026-06-22). Feed render format had drifted from the documented regex (no "daily" line; trailing date has no "· slot") — parsed via a block-based parser instead. Graphed 3 new theme edges; 25 skipped. All 245 visible keys folded into seen (540→568); last_event_date=2026-06-22.

**Edges added (4 new rows):**
- AMD → benefits from → T_COWOS (FACT, X-scan 2026-06-22): Lisa Su/Computex >$10B Taiwan advanced-packaging investment.
- MU → benefits from → T_INFER (VIEW, Needham 2026-06-22): AI demand + limited capacity extend memory upcycle; DRAM pricing.
- LRCX → benefits from → T_COWOS (VIEW, Mizuho 2026-06-22): advanced-packaging incremental semicap demand.
- AMAT → benefits from → T_COWOS (VIEW, Mizuho 2026-06-22): advanced-packaging incremental semicap demand.

**Edges strengthened (no new rows):**
- NVDA sells GPUs to DELL — was evidence "None" → (FACT, X-scan 2026-06-22): Dell named Vera Rubin (NVL4) builder at ISC 2026; strength 2→3.
- SKHYNIX supplies HBM to NVDA — appended HBM4E 12-layer samples (Jun 18), NVDA sole requester.
- SKHYNIX benefits from T_HBM — appended FACT HBM4E sampling (48GB/stack, ~16Gbps/pin).
- NVDA sells GPUs to SMCI — appended SMCI as Vera Rubin NVL4 global system builder (ISC 2026).

**New companies added:** none (all referenced nodes already existed).

**Validator:** errors=0, warnings=173 — PASS (nodes=158, edges=393). Graph + START HERE + Degree sheet regenerated. Excel not open; xlsx written directly (no pending CSV).

**Feed events skipped (25) — reasons:**
- No AI supply-chain mechanism / consumer / software-sentiment: ZG, RBLX, NFLX, MSFT, GOOGL, BILL, AXON, AAPL, TSLA, TEL, META(06-11).
- Bearish/valuation reprice with no positive supply-chain edge: STX (HDD pricing downgrade), ASML (catch-up/valuation note, no clean theme to attach).
- Quantum (out of AI-semis scope): IONQ.
- Speculative SpaceX-neocloud thesis, already-central & redundant: NVDA (Blackwell demand), SMCI (server cycle) — both already benefit from T_TRAIN/T_INFER; SPCX (KeyBanc Sector Weight, no theme node).
- Garbled/ambiguous attribution: AMD burn-in/transceiver checks item (AMD already covered today via T_COWOS).
- Restatements of existing edges (not re-added): SNDK→T_INFER, MU→T_HBM, INTC→T_GLASS, LITE→T_NET, CRDO→T_NET, COHR→T_CPO, AAOI→T_CPO, SMCI→T_TRAIN.

**Notes:** VIEW vs FACT discipline applied (analyst PTs/forecasts → VIEW; stated supply/capacity facts → FACT). No instruction-like inbox files encountered.
